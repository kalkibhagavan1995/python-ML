Automate EDA along with selection of required ML Algorithm


1. File Upload
    -   Input Block:
        -   Action: User uploads a dataset file (e.g., CSV, Excel).
          -   Tool: Streamlit file_uploader widget.
    -   Output: Loaded dataset.
2. Data Preprocessing
   -    Processing Block:
        - Action: Perform initial preprocessing (e.g., handling missing values, data type conversions).
        - Tool: Python (Pandas, NumPy).
   - Output: Cleaned dataset.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - EDA Block:
     - Action: 
       - Display various EDA visualizations and statistics.
       - Summary statistics (mean, median, mode).
       - Correlation matrix.
       - Histograms, box plots, scatter plots.
       - Pair plots for feature relationships. 
     - Tool: Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib), Streamlit for visualization.
   - Output: Visual insights and descriptive statistics.
4. ML Algorithm Selection
Selection Block:
Action: User selects an ML algorithm from a predefined list (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest).
Tool: Streamlit selectbox or radio widget.
Output: Selected ML algorithm.
5. Model Training
Training Block:
Action: Train the selected ML algorithm on the dataset.
Tool: Python (Scikit-learn).
Output: Trained model.
6. Model Evaluation
Evaluation Block:
Action: Display model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, RMSE, MAE).
Tool: Python (Scikit-learn), Streamlit for displaying metrics.
Output: Model performance metrics.
7. Prediction (Optional)
Prediction Block:
Action: Allow user to input new data for predictions.
Tool: Streamlit form or input fields.
Output: Model predictions.
8. Results Display
Output Block:
Action: Display the final results, including model performance and predictions.
Tool: Streamlit for results display.
Output: Final results and visualizations.
Execution Flow:
File Upload: User uploads a dataset file.
Data Preprocessing: Dataset is cleaned and prepared.
EDA: EDA is performed and visualizations are displayed.
ML Algorithm Selection: User selects an ML algorithm.
Model Training: Selected model is trained on the dataset.
Model Evaluation: Model performance is evaluated and metrics are displayed.
Prediction (Optional): User can input new data for predictions.
Results Display: Final results and predictions are displayed.
This workflow can be implemented using Python, with Streamlit for the web interface, and libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn for EDA and ML tasks.
